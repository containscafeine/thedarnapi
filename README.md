## The Darn Api

The API server to which every client connects to.

It is a gRPC API and has been defined using Protocol Buffers.

### Running the server

For now, a 64-bit binary for the current master can be found under the bin/ directory of the project.

To run the server, run the command `bin/thedarnapi` from the root of the project, and local server listening on `localhost:8080` will start.
